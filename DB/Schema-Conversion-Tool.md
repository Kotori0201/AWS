# What
You can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to convert your existing database schema from one database engine to another. You can convert relational OLTP schema, or data warehouse schema. Your converted schema is suitable for an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL DB, an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, or an Amazon Redshift cluster. The converted schema can also be used with a database on an Amazon EC2 instance or stored as data on an Amazon S3 bucket.
